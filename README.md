# Platformer
Prototype platformer that could be used for JS games in future. Uses Webpack &amp; Phaser.

### Ok, so what can you do with it?
Right now it's nothing but a simple jumping platformer. It hasn't really got much else going for it. No enemies, pickups, etc.

### Any plans to make it less thin?
Of course! In fact I aim to keep adding extra features, plus, make those features entirely decoupled (or near enough) if I can help it.

### Awesome! What does it work on currently?
It's only tested in the Chrome browser at this stage. But as things flesh out a bit, I'd imagine it 'should' work pretty well in a full range of sneaky devices.

### Can I contribute?
By all means! The more the merrier. But the plan is to keep the codebase as clean as possible, so there may be a few 'strict' things to be aware of initially. I'll write these up as time goes on (and as I figure them out).

### Anything else?
Be aware that it's using Phaser with Webpack too. So you'll need to have Node installed, do the usual 'npm install' at root level, etc.
